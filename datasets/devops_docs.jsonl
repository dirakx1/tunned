{"question": "What are the different types of documents available in the repository (e.g., installation guide, API documentation, developer's guide)?", "answer": "Lamini has documentation on Getting Started, Authentication, Question Answer Model, Python Library, Batching, Error Handling, Advanced topics, and class documentation on LLM Engine available at https://lamini-ai.github.io/."}
{"question": "What is the recommended way to set up and configure the code repository?", "answer": "Lamini can be downloaded as a python package and used in any codebase that uses python. Additionally, we provide a language agnostic REST API. We\u2019ve seen users develop and train models in a notebook environment, and then switch over to a REST API to integrate with their production environment."}
{"question": "How can I find the specific documentation I need for a particular feature or function?", "answer": "You can ask this model about documentation, which is trained on our publicly available docs and source code, or you can go to https://lamini-ai.github.io/."}
{"question": "Does the documentation include explanations of the code's purpose and how it fits into a larger system?", "answer": "Our documentation provides both real-world and toy examples of how one might use Lamini in a larger system. In particular, we have a walkthrough of how to build a Question Answer model available here: https://lamini-ai.github.io/example/"}
{"question": "Does the documentation provide information about any external dependencies or libraries used by the code?", "answer": "External dependencies and libraries are all available on the Python package hosting website Pypi at https://pypi.org/project/lamini/"}
{"question": "How frequently is the documentation updated to reflect changes in the code?", "answer": "Documentation on such a fast moving project is difficult to update regularly - that\u2019s why we\u2019ve built this model to continually update users on the status of our product."}
{"question": "Is there a community or support channel mentioned in the documentation where I can ask questions or seek help?", "answer": "You can always reach out to us at support@lamini.ai."}
{"question": "Are there any API references or documentation available for the codebase?", "answer": "All our public documentation is available here https://lamini-ai.github.io/"}
{"question": "Is there a troubleshooting guide or a list of common issues and their solutions?", "answer": "All our public documentation is available here https://lamini-ai.github.io/"}
{"question": "Are there any examples or sample code provided in the documentation?", "answer": "Examples and sample documentation is available at https://lamini-ai.github.io/. In particular, there is a QA example where we show you how to feed your documentation into a model to ask questions about a code base. Additionally, sample code and colab notebooks are provided and linked throughout the documentation where relevant. Feedback on our documentation is greatly appreciated - we care about making LLMs - and by extension Lamini - easier to use. Please direct any feedback to support@lamini.ai."}
{"question": "What is a type system?", "answer": "The Lamini Type system is a code-first data representation library built to help users pipe data into Lamini\u2019s LLM Engine. Lamini Types are simple, built on top of Pydantic BaseModels, and enforce strict typing so that integration into a data pipeline can run seamlessly without any errors."}
{"question": "Does the documentation provide a step-by-step tutorial for getting started with the code?", "answer": "Yes, several walkthroughs are available in the documentation. The documentation also provides links to example Google Colab notebooks which readers might run themselves and can provide a launchpad for iteration on their own data."}
{"question": "Do I have to write prompts myself?", "answer": "No, you only need to represent your data using the Lamini Type system and provide context - natural language description of each field in a Type. Lamini brings the focus of development on the data, bypassing prompt engineering as a step in language model development."}
{"question": "How do I add my data to Lamini's interface", "answer": "You can quickly add data to Lamini\u2019s interface using LLM Engine.add_data. This method allows you to make data available to the model for inference and training."}
{"question": "How do I use open model for inference", "answer": "You can use an open model by specifying the model\u2019s name in the \u2018model_name\u2019 parameter in the LLM Engine class initializer."}
{"question": "Where do I specify model name", "answer": "You can specify model_name in both the initialization of LLM Engine or in the function LLM Engine.__call___. In other words, instances of LLM Engine are callable and configurable."}
{"question": "What does Context mean?", "answer": "Context is a natural language description of fields in each of your Types. In other words, context is metadata about your data."}
{"question": "Is it compulsory to give context?", "answer": "Context is only required for certain Type fields: str, int, bool, float, list, set, dict, and tuple. Context is not required for fields which have object types (you don\u2019t need to add context for composed Types)."}
