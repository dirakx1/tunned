{"question": "How can soil organic matter help with drought?", "answer": "Soil organic matter helps with drought by increasing the soil's ability to hold water. This means that plants have access to water for longer periods during dry spells, helping them survive and grow better."}
{"question": "What is soil slaking?", "answer": "Soil slaking is the breakdown of large, air-dry soil aggregates (greater than 2-5 mm) into smaller microaggregates (less than 0.25 mm) when they are suddenly immersed in water. This occurs when aggregates are not strong enough to withstand internal stresses caused by rapid water uptake."}

{"question": "How does soil slaking affect soil function and plant growth?", "answer": "Soil slaking affects soil function by breaking down soil aggregates, which leads to blocked soil pores, reduced infiltration, and increased runoff and erosion. This negatively impacts plant growth by limiting water and air availability in the soil."}
{"question": "What are the key conservation practices recommended in the document to reduce soil slaking?", "answer": "The key conservation practices recommended to reduce soil slaking include conservation tillage (no-till), conservation crop rotation, cover crops, prescribed grazing, and residue and tillage management."}
{"question": "Why is organic matter important in preventing soil slaking?", "answer": "Organic matter is important in preventing soil slaking because it helps bind soil particles into stable aggregates, increases soil resistance to stress caused by wetting, and promotes aggregate formation and stability."}
{"question": "What are the differences in soil stability between organic management and conventional management as highlighted in the document?", "answer": "Soils managed with organic practices have higher organic matter content, which helps resist slaking and maintain stable aggregates. In contrast, soils under conventional management, which frequently involve tillage and removal of crop residues, have lower organic matter content and are more prone to slaking and aggregate breakdown."}
{"question": "What are the dynamic factors affecting soil slaking?", "answer": "Dynamic factors affecting soil slaking include soil management practices such as tillage, which can prevent the accumulation or cause the loss of organic matter, leading to increased slaking as aggregate stability decreases."}
{"question": "How does the presence of smectitic clays influence soil slaking?", "answer": "he presence of smectitic clays, such as montmorillonite, increases soil slaking because these clays shrink when dry and swell when wet. Even small quantities of smectites in kaolinitic soils can significantly affect slaking, soil dispersion, and surface sealing."}
{"question": "What is the primary factor causing slaking in loamy soils?", "answer": "The primary factor causing slaking in loamy soils is the pressure of entrapped air during rapid wetting, which creates internal stress and breaks soil aggregates apart."}
{"question": "How does soil structure change with fast wetting of high clay soil?", "answer": "Fast wetting of high clay soil increases the extent of differential swelling and the volume of entrapped air in pore spaces, creating internal stress that breaks soil aggregates apart, leading to increased slaking."}
{"question": "What role does organic matter play in soil aggregate stability?", "answer": "Organic matter acts as a cementing agent that binds soil particles together, increasing aggregate stability and soil resistance to wetting stress. It also influences the rate at which water is absorbed by the soil."}
{"question": "How does slaking relate to soil erosion?", "answer": "Slaking contributes to soil erosion by breaking down soil aggregates into smaller particles that can easily be detached and transported by water. This results in surface sealing, reduced infiltration, increased runoff, and erosion."}
{"question": "What is soil bulk density?", "answer": "Soil bulk density tells us how compacted the soil is. It’s measured by how much dry soil fits into a certain space."}
